Weekly Exercise #2: Unfair Dice

Include Files:
    * unfairDice.py
    * README

Running Instructions:
    When running the program unfairDice.py, the user would see a sample test result
    which is a 6-sided unfair die rolls for 20 times. Each value on the side of the
    dice(1 to 6) has the probability of 1/2, 1/4, 1/3, 1/12, 1/12, 1/6 respectively to
    be rolled.

    The list shows the number on the side of the dice when the dice is rolled each time.
    In this sample, 20 numbers will be displayed

    The histogram displays the time of each number(1-6, in this sample) appears.
Notes and Assumptions:
    The program assumes that the die will always have at least 2 sides
    (m >= 2, if m <= 1, a semantic error will occur. Ex. if m == 1, ZeroDivisionError will occur)
