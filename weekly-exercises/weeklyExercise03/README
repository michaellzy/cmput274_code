   Weekly Exercise #3: Word Frequency
-------------------------------------

Included Files:
    * freq.py
    * README

Running Instructions:
    1. Open the terminal, find the directory of freq.py and input text file
    2. Run the program, by typing python3 freq.py <input_file_name>

    If the user types more or less command-line arguments, an error message
    will be shown in the terminal.
    A new plain text file <input_file_name.out> would add to the program's directory

Notes and Assumptions:
    1. the input text should be plain text file and in the same directory as the freq.py
    2. can not be empty text file

Additional Feature:
    If the input file does not exist, an error message would
    show in the terminal: File Error:[Error 2] No such file or directory: <input file name>
