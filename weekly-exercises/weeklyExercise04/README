   Weekly Exercise #4: Text Preprocessor
-------------------------------------

Included Files:
    * preprocess.py
    * README

Running Instructions:
    1. Open the terminal, find the directory of preprocess.py
    2. Run the program, by typing python3 preprocess.py <mode>
    3. Input any text.

    The output will remove all the punctuations, numbers(would not remove if a token consists only numbers)
    and stopwords.

    * <mode> is an optional command.
    If the user does not enter anything, the program would remove
    all the elements above.
    If the user enters the mode <keep-digits>, all numbers would be kept, the punctuations and stopwords
    would be removed.
    If the user enters the mode <keep-stops>, all stopwords would be kept, the punctuations and numbers
    would be removed.
    If the user enters the mode <keep-symbols>, all punctuations would be kept, the numbers and stopwords
    would be removed.
    If the user enters invalid mode, an error message would be shown in the terminal.

Notes and Assumptions:
    1. could not input more than one mode
    2. the input text needs to be string.
